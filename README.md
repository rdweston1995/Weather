Weather App

Got tired of all the current weather apps on the market and the amount of ads they include. Creating this project to work on web development skills and build something that I personally would use daily. Going to gather the weather data from the national weather service api. I plan on integrating cookies to the site to be able to store saved locations chosen by the user.
